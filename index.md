That’s me  
I am a  
woman.  
I have a body.  
My body  
‘is a social  
construction  
rather than  
a naturally  
given  
datum.’  

Hi, I am Giulia Tomasello designer and researcher based in London 
currently graduated from [Ma Material Futures](http://www.mamaterialfutures.tumblr.com/) in Central Saint Martins.
Born in Italy I studied my BA in Product Design at NABA, Milan
and lived for one year in Netherlands 
studying Social Design at Design Academy of Eindhoven.
As a designer I am looking to raise awareness, to expose assumptions, 
to provoke actions and to spark critical debates. 
My aim is to design alternative scenarios, acting as a creative thinker. 
I consider materiality as a tool to question and communicate the boundaries 
between technology and us. 
Since [RUAH](http://blog.arduino.cc/2013/04/27/an-interactive-corset-teaching-you-how-to-breath/), my BA Graduation Project I started a continuous research on wearable future and smart materials using an open source philosophy and a trans-disciplinary design approach.
These last two years I've been experimenting and growing living organisms.

2015 [Bio Conductive Skin](http://cargocollective.com/bioconductiveskin). work.in.progress - Technology is getting closer and closer to our skin. This project explores the possibilities of creating biomaterials and proposes alternative applications to our current electronic components.

2016 [Future Flora](http://cargocollective.com/futureflora). MA Graduation Project - Future Flora proposes a Citizen Science alternative to probiotics, empowering women via Biophilia and Speculating the possibility of wearing Lactobacillus to prevent Candida Infection.
